# Gaming-Arena
I along with my two team mates created the project Gaming Arena as our end of semester project.
Gaming Arena consist of two games for the users to enjoy which were:

1) Scramble : Players are given 5 words along with hints. They are require to guess the words within 3 tries. Those who fail to guess the correct word within 3 tries would lose the game. In the end you would be granted score based on your performance
  
2) Rusty Brains (Quiz game) : Users are require to register their names before proceeding with the game. Quiz consists of two rounds, warm up round and challenge round. If you pass the warm up round than you are eligible for challenge round. Warm up consists of 3 questions. If you answer two out of three questions correctly you can proceed to challenge round which consists of 10 questions. If you fail to answer more than three questions in challenge round you will lose the game.User can the check the score and ratings in the view score section.
